# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
 Using machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict the likelihood of stroke.

# Overview of the project
A stroke is a serious medical condition caused by the interruption of blood flow to the brain, resulting in cell death
and loss of brain function. Early detection and treatment are essential for successful recovery from a stroke. In this
project, we aim to predict the occurrence of stroke based on various risk factors, including age, gender, hypertension,
heart disease, smoking status, and BMI. We will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and predict
the likelihood of stroke.
